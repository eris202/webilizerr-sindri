                  Depending on the date they were published, some articles use Disqus and others use the Facebook

                  you leave. Of course all comments you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your
                  name, so we do not imagine this is a concern for many people.

                  tools, we share basic information with Intercom such as your name and email address so that we can
